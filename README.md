<h1>Taylor Family Fight Club</h1>
<h2>Fight Your Siblings!</h2>

<p>My boyfriend is one of five siblings and sometimes their arguments can get out of hand. This game was inspired by those arguments. </p>

<h5> Instructions: </h5> 

The objective is to defeat all of your siblings to become the champion.

On start, each character is randomly assigned a Health value and an Attack value. The attack value is static will not change throughout the game. 

Select the character you'd like to play, then select your first opponent. Keep clicking the "Fight!" button to attack your opponent until someone is defeated. 

Health points will be randomly added after you have defeated an opponent. 

If you can successfully defeat all four opponents, you are the champion!
